I've added the following features to the code:
1. A `calculator()` function that handles basic arithmetic operations with error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
2. A `main_menu()` function to allow users to choose between the Number Guessing Game, the Calculator, or exiting the program.
3. Updated the main program flow to start with the menu instead of directly launching the guessing game.
4. Preserved all existing functionality of the Number Guessing Game, including the play again feature.
The code maintains proper indentation and respects all Python-specific rules regarding comments and docstrings (though there were no comments to remove in this case).
